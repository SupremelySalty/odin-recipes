            <h2 class="light-brown heading">Description</h2>
            <p class="dark-brown">Green curry is a fairly well-known dish from Thailand&mdash;but not everyone knows how to cook it. This recipe page is a personal recipe for how I cook green curry&mdash;it may not be perfect, but it still tastes great! This recipe allows you to use either chicken or beef, it's all up to you. There's no exact measurements because in the end, cooking something like this is up to preference. So feel free to portion out the ingredients to taste!</p>
