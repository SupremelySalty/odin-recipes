            <h2 class="light-brown heading">Description</h2>
            <p class="dark-brown">Fried rice is a classic dish that many people know how to make&mdash;but this is my own personal way of making it. As someone who grew up in Chinese-Indonesian culture, this was based on the fried rice I grew up eating, cooked by my own mother. You'll notice there are no portions for some of the ingredients&mdash;this is because cooking, to me, is less of a science and more of an art. Feel free to portion out ingredients to your own tastes!</p>
            <h2 class="light-brown heading">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="dark-brown">
                <li>White rice, preferably leftover day old rice</li>
                <li>Egg</li>
                <li>Chinese soy sauce</li>
                <li>Ground pepper, black or white are both fine</li>
                <li>Granulated sugar of choice</li>
                <li>Scallions</li>
                <li>Half of an onion</li>
                <li>Fish sauce (optional)</li>
                <li>Meat of choice, preferably shrimp or chicken (optional)</li>
                <li>Neutral cooking oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="light-brown heading">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="dark-brown">
                <li>Cut off the root, then chop the scallions; feel free to portion these out according to taste. Chop half an onion finely.</li>
                <li>If you want to add meat, prepare it before actually starting to cook. Do not cook them, they will be cooked with the fried rice.</li>
                <li>Heat up some of the oil in a pan. Wait for it to get hot before proceeding.</li>
                <li>Put the onions in the pan and cook them until they turn transparent. If you decide to add meat, add it to the pan and cook until roughly half done after the onions.</li>
                <li>Add the rice to the pan and toss. You can either mix with a spatula, toss with just the pan, or a mixture of both.</li>
                <li>Crack the egg (or eggs, if you want more egg in the fried rice) into the pan and mix and toss it with the rice. Add chinese soy sauce, sugar, and pepper to the fried rice to taste at this stage. If you have fish sauce, add that as well.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove from heat then add scallions and mix. Serve on a plate and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
